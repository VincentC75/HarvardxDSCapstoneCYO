# Harvardx Data Science Capstone CYO project

This is my personal project for the Harvardx Data Science Specialization Capstone (PH125.9x) project.

This project is based on the "Rain in Australia" datasaset available on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
The goal is to predict wether or not it will rain tomorrow by training a binary classification model.

Available Files:
* CapstoneCYO.Rmd: Main R Markdown project file
* CapstoneCYO.pdf: PDF output from the .Rmd file
* CapstoneCYO_code.R: Code extract from the .Rmd file to build all models.
